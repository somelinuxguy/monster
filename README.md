# monster
Learning python3, I decided to write a quick game to teach myself.

# How to play:
There is a haunted house, five stories tall and five rooms per floor, 0 indexes because computers.

Your task is to find the Last Will and Testament of grandma. You must search the house by guessing a floor, and a room. When you open the door, if the monster is in that room, you get eaten. If the monster is not in that room, you win!

To run the code just install python3 and then: `python3 monster.py` should have you on your way.

# To Do

Make it 1 to 5 instead of 0-4 because humans don't start counting with 0 even though they should.

# What did I learn here?
First I had to come up with a way to loop through a user input process, that checks his input and asks again if it isn't valid before it checks if his move killed him or not. This made me sit and think about conditionals for a while, and how to navigate them in Python.

I also split some things in to functions, better to do that than write the same code twice.

Lists are fun, lists of lists are more fun.

I also just learned classes and class methods. Neat!
